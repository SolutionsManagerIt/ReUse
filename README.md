# ReUse
Since most recent programming languages open source codes are not well designed, we decided to make a Well designed common collaborative code frameworks with simple main principles :

    heavy focus on typical code reuse
    designed to be a common code library
    ultra minimalistic standard names
    well defined comments
    allow to use extensions based on core framework
    lightweight and highly efficient
    standard common languages base types support with extensions to custom language types

Currently we have got a [.NET implementation](https://solutionsmanagerit.github.io/ReUse_Net/) with a little bit of base common code.
Once overall framework properties are ready - it will be easy to port it to other languages (both base and specific, platform dependent code parts). 

# Contribute to ReUse

This task will require a lot of work, so your help would be highly appreciated.
We will need almost everyone - from web-designers and graphics experts (to prepare sites and marketing materials) to content managers, testers, code and security experts, discussions boards administrators and managers an so on.

If you are skilled enough and want to train your coding skills (in almost any platform) with really challenging attitude - contact us - there is a lot of work to do.
You are graduated (or graduating) in coding/it/projects management and want to practice some modern coding style - let us know.
You would like to create stunning infografics materials/presentations or great logo styles/design - let us know. 

Your help would be also enlisted in special Titles list (just same as in the movies) - so you will get involved in the history of the project.

Also I guess we would need some financial aid to make it all floating and riding - so sales persons, project managers, security experts are welcome too.
In the future, if everything will go just fine - we will make a special private Pro expert versions with additional expert level functions (only to true professionals) - so it would be possible to monetize it a little bit.

So if you want to participate in this project - let us know.
If you like the idea - just spread a good word about it.
