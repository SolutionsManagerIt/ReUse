# ReUse
Since most recent programming languages open source codes are not well designed, we decided to make a Well designed common collaborative code frameworks with simple main principles :

    heavy focus on typical code reuse
    designed to be a common code library
    ultra minimalistic standard names
    well defined comments
    allow to use extensions based on core framework
    lightweight and highly efficient
    standard common languages base types support with extensions to custom language types
